# Telecom-Customer-Churn-Prediction
My first Data Science project on predicting telecom customer churn. Includes data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest). Achieved ~82% accuracy. Identified key churn factors like tenure, monthly charges, and total charges, with actionable insights.
# Telecom Customer Churn Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
This project predicts whether a customer will churn (leave the company) using machine learning models.  
It covers data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and predictive modeling.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, Random Forest)

## 🚀 Key Results
- Logistic Regression: ~82% accuracy
- Random Forest: ~80% accuracy
- Top churn factors: Tenure, Monthly Charges, Total Charges

## 💡 Business Recommendations
- Offer benefits to new customers
- Provide flexible pricing for high-charge customers
- Encourage yearly contracts to reduce churn
