# Telecom-Customer-Churn-Prediction
My first Data Science project on predicting telecom customer churn. Includes data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest). Achieved ~82% accuracy. Identified key churn factors like tenure, monthly charges, and total charges, with actionable insights.
